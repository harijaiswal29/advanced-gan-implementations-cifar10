Task 1: Implement and train a conditional Wesserstein GAN with CIFAR10 dataset. Generate and display 10 new images belonging to 'automobile' class. Report IS and FID scores.

Task 2: Implement and train a SNGAN with CIFAR10 dataset. Generate and display 10 new images. Report IS and FID scores.

Task 3: Implement and train a variant of SAGAN **without** spectral normalization and TTUB  with CIFAR10 dataset. Generate 10 new images. Report IS and FID scores.

Task 4: Implement and train a complete SAGAN with CIFAR10 dataset. Generate and display 10 new images. Report IS and FID scores.

Task 5: Summarize your observations.
